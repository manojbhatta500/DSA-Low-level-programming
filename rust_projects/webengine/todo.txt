2️⃣ File Metadata, Stop Words, and Sorting

File Metadata: Store extra information in your SearchResult struct, such as file size, last modified date, and full file path.

Stop Words: Maintain a list of common words like ["the", "and", "a", "of"] and ignore them when counting keyword matches.

Sort by Relevance: Rank results using match_count or a weighted score so the most relevant files appear at the top.

3️⃣ HTML Parsing

Initially, just strip HTML tags so that only visible text is searched.

Optional enhancements:

Ignore <script> and <style> blocks.

Extract headings (<h1>, <h2>) for snippets.

Optionally extract links and images for richer results.

4️⃣ Search History

Keep track of previous searches.

Can be stored in a database or a file for future reference.

Useful for showing past searches or providing search suggestions.
